* Finding Packages
- https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=anki&branch=edge
* Anki install
- Overall both attempts below fail.
- The =beta= fails as it does not give me a working anki binary
- The =testing= fails as it requires =ankirspy= that fails to exist
  anymore
** Using Beta
- The flatpak version seems not be able to update itself. Thus we need:

  [[https://betas.ankiweb.net/intro.html][Anki Intro and Download]]
- However this is not enough, we need various packages before we can
  run all the instructions listed here.
*** Packages needed
- sudo apk add python3-dev
- sudo apk add qt5-qtsystems-dev
- sudo apk add py3-qtwebengine
- sudo apk add qt5-qtmultimedia
- sudo apk add py3-qtwebengine
- sudo apk add py3-qt5
  + This fixes the qt5 package error when trying to install anki via
    pip
- sudo apk add portaudio
- sudo apk add py3-pyaudio
- sudo apk add py3-wheel
- sudo apk add py3-flask
- _Unlikely but grabbed_
  + sudo apk add py3-sip-pyqt5
** Using Testing
- Just grab it from the repo after going through [[test]]
- _However that is not enough we also need to run_
  + sudo pip install aqt
    * This basically grabs the
* Enable Testing Packages <<test>>
- The testing repository is disabled by default, just run the
  following
  + sudo emacs /etc/apk/repositories
    * _add to the end of the list_

  + =sudo apk update=
* Keyboard install
** Changing the original keyboard
- =sudo apk add wayland-dev git make musl-dev pango-dev cairo-dev
  pkg-config libxcb-dev libxkbcommon-dev=
- =git clone https://github.com/jjsullivan5196/wvkbd=
  + Edit the =config.def.h= to remove all the extra keyboards
* Configuration
- Just run the rsync script with the desired function
- Note that global files will have to be moved by hand to =/bin/usr/=
  as Î™ can't input a password
* dwm
- =sudo apk add git make gcc g++ libx11-dev libxft-dev libxinerama-dev ncurses dbus-x11 firefox-esr adwaita-gtk2-theme adwaita-icon-theme ttf-dejavu=
* Ideas

** Workspace Management
- instead of their wraparound technique which is lackluster, set it up
  so that
  + Swipping on the side just calls
    * =sway workspace next=
    * =swap workspace prev=
  + And have a new gesture for making a new workspace

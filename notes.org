* Finding Packages
- https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=anki&branch=edge
* Anki install
- Overall both attempts below fail.
- The =beta= fails as it does not give me a working anki binary
- The =testing= fails as it requires =ankirspy= that fails to exist

** Using Beta
- The flatpak version seems not be able to update itself. Thus we need:

  [[https://betas.ankiweb.net/intro.html][Anki Intro and Download]]
- However this is not enough, we need various packages before we can
  run all the instructions listed here.
*** Packages needed

- sudo apk add qt5-qtsystems-dev
- sudo apk add py3-qtwebengine
- sudo apk add qt5-qtmultimedia

    pip
- sudo apk add portaudio
- sudo apk add py3-pyaudio
- sudo apk add py3-wheel
- sudo apk add py3-flask

  + sudo apk add py3-sip-pyqt5

  + sudo pip install aqt
    * This basically grabs the
* Enable Testing Packages <<test>>
- The testing repository is disabled by default, just run the
